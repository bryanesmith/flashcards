"VPC network peering","Enables communication between VPC networks directly using internal IP addresses via route exchange and VPC peering groups, publishing SaSS offering privately that can be accessed from another VPC network"
"VPC peering groups","Set of VPC networks connected through direct VPC peerings. (A topology of VPCs will have one peering group per VPC.)"
"Identity Aware Proxy (IAP)","Allows users & services to access private network resources form untrusted networks (without use of a VPN) using a central authorization layer with application-level access control (instead of network-level firewalls)"
"IAP tunnels","Allow forward TCP traffic outside network into private GCE instances using public Google Cloud API, gcloud, or GCP Console acting as intermediary"
"Zero Trust","Security mpde; requiring all users (inside or outside network) to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access"
"context-aware access","Restrict access to sensitive apps using conditional logic in addition to IAM. E.g., user on trusted corpoate device with up-to-date patch levels; restrict all access to /admin resources to privileged group"
"Cloud VPN","Securely connects peer network to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN (i.e., secured) connection"
"Private Service Connect","Google solution to consume managed or custom services outside VPC network, using one of two types of private endpoints"
"Two types of Private Service Connect endpoints","1) Private Service Connect endpoint (consumer endpoint using NAT to route to service producer); 2) Private Service Connect endpoint with consumer HTTPs service controls (load-balancer with TLS certificates)"
