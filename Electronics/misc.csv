"closed loop","circuit with a complete path from negative to positive terminal of a battery"
"Ohm's law","V = RI (V = voltage, R = resistance, I = current)"
"Ampere","measurement of current (I)"
"Ohm","measurement of resistance (R)"
"LDR","light-dependent resistor (abbr)"
"transistor","electronic components that act as a switch; electricity only flows from collector to emitter when turned on"
"diode","electronic component that conducts current in only one direction"
"potentiometer","electronic component with tunable resistance value by turning it's shaft"
"capacitor","electronic components that store electric capacity, stabilizing voltage & power flow/smoothing out the output of power supplies"
"PCB","printed circuit board (abbr)"
"FR4","Fiberglass-reinforced epoxy-laminated sheets. (abbr) Circuit boards are usually made of this."
"passive electronic components","electronic components that do not generate nor rely on electrical power (e.g., resistors)"
"component leads","the legs on electronic components"
"switch","device with on and off state that controls flow of electric power by connecting and disconnecting electric circuit"
"pushbutton switch","small component that completes circuit when you press it"
"polarized","only allow current to flow in one direction"
"anode","positive end of diode (usu longer leg)"
"cathode","negative end of diode (usu shorter leg)"
"capacitance","measurement of ability of electronic component to store electrical energy"
"Farad (F)","unit of capacitance"
"cold joints","when soldering, incompletely fusing joint due to insufficient melting"
"bridging","when excess soldering inadvertently neighboring solder pads, which can lead to short circuits"
"insufficient wetting","failure to put enough solder to cover pin and pad"
"Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)","electronic circuit that transforms digital data to analog audio signal & sends it to an amplifier"
"D/A","digital to analog conversion (abbr)"
